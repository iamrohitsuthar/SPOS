## System Programming and Operating System Programs

This page contains the list of practicals for SPOS

**GROUP A**
1. [PassOne Assembler](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/PassOneAssembler)<br>
(Design suitable data structures and implement pass-I of a two-pass assembler for pseudo-machine in  Java using object-oriented feature. Implementation should consist of a few instructions from each category and few assembler directives.)

2. [PassTwo Assembler](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/PassTwoAssembler)<br>
(Implement Pass-II of a two-pass assembler for pseudo-machine in Java using object-oriented features. The output of  assignment-1  (intermediate  file  and  symbol  table) should be input for this assignment)

3. [PassOne MacroProcessor](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/PassOneMacroProcessor)<br>
(Design suitable data structures and implement pass-I of a two-pass macro-processor using OOP features in Java)

4. [PassTwo MacroProcessor](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/PassTwoMacroProcessor)<br>
(Write a Java program for pass-II of a two-pass macro-processor. The output of assignment-3 (MNT, MDT, and file without any macro definitions) should be input for this assignment)

**GROUP B**
1. [LEX Java Subset Prgram](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/LEX_JAVA_PROGRAM_TOKENS)<br>
(Write a program using Lex specifications to implement lexical analysis phase of the compiler to generate tokens of subset of  ̳Java‘ program)

2. [LEX File Stats Program](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/LEX_FILE_STATS)<br>
(Write a program using Lex specifications to implement lexical analysis phase of the compiler to count no. of words, lines, and characters of the given input file)

3. [Yacc Program Java Variable Declaration Syntax validation](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/YACC_VARIABLE_DECLARATION)<br>
(Write a program using YACC specifications to implement the syntax analysis phase of the compiler to validate type and syntax of variable declaration in Java.)

**GROUP C**
1. [Scheduling Algorithms](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/Scheduling%20Algorithms)<br>
Write a Java program using OOP features to implement the following scheduling algorithms: 
* FCFS
* SJF (Preemptive)
* Priority (Non-Preemptive)
* Round Robin (Preemptive)

2. [Banker's Algorithm](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/Bankers_Algorithm)<br/>
Write a java program to implement Banker's Algorithm.
