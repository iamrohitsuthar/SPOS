(Design suitable data structures and implement pass-I of a two-pass assembler for pseudo-machine in  Java using object-oriented feature. Implementation should consist of a few instructions from each category and few assembler directives.)

2. [PassTwo Assembler](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/PassTwoAssembler)<br>
(Implement Pass-II of a two-pass assembler for pseudo-machine in Java using object-oriented features. The output of  assignment-1  (intermediate  file  and  symbol  table) should be input for this assignment)

3. [PassOne MacroProcessor](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/PassOneMacroProcessor)<br>
(Design suitable data structures and implement pass-I of a two-pass macro-processor using OOP features in Java)

4. [PassTwo MacroProcessor](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/PassTwoMacroProcessor)<br>
(Write a Java program for pass-II of a two-pass macro-processor. The output of assignment-3 (MNT, MDT, and file without any macro definitions) should be input for this assignment)

**GROUP B**
1. [DLL Program](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/DLL)<br>
(Write a program to create Dynamic Link Library for any mathematical operation and write an application program to test it. [Java Native Interface / Use VB or VC++])

2. [LEX Java Subset Prgram](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/LEX_JAVA_PROGRAM_TOKENS)<br>
(Write a program using Lex specifications to implement lexical analysis phase of the compiler to generate tokens of subset of  Ì³Java program.)

3. [LEX File Stats Program](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/LEX_FILE_STATS)<br>
(Write a program using Lex specifications to implement lexical analysis phase of the compiler to count no. of words, lines, and characters of the given input file.)

4. [Yacc Program Java Variable Declaration Syntax validation](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/YACC_VARIABLE_DECLARATION)<br>
(Write a program using YACC specifications to implement the syntax analysis phase of the compiler to validate type and syntax of variable declaration in Java.)

5. [YACC Program for sentence recognization](https://github.com/iamrohitsuthar/SPOS/tree/master/YACC_SENTENCE_CHECK)<br>
(Write a program using YACC specifications to implement syntax analysis phase of compiler to recognize simple and compound sentences given in input file.)
